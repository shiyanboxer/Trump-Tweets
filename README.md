# Trump Tweets

![Results](https://github.com/shiyanboxer/Trump-Tweets/blob/master/GraphT.png)

Last week I built a Twitter Sentiment Analysis program that takes the first 1000 tweets containing the word "Trump" and outputs a graph of positive, negative, and neutral tweets. The program was developed using Twitter's RESTful API, Python, NLTK, Matplotlib, NumPy, and Regular Expression. The model is based on Naive Bayes Classifier theorem which finds the probability of an event occurring given the probability of another event that has already occurred. The results are the following: 16% negative, 0% positive, and 84% neutral.
